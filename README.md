# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using Custom CNN (PyTorch)

This project implements an end-to-end deep learning pipeline to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using a **custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built in **PyTorch**.  
It includes data preprocessing, augmentation, model training with checkpoints, evaluation metrics, Grad-CAM visualization, and a simple inference & deployment setup.
