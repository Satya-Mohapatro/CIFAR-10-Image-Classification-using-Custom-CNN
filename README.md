# CIFAR-10-Image-Classification-using-Custom-CNN
A complete end-to-end deep learning project built with PyTorch for classifying CIFAR-10 images using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Includes dataset pipeline, augmentation, training loop with early stopping &amp; checkpointing, evaluation (confusion matrix + Grad-CAM), and deployment-ready inference scripts.
